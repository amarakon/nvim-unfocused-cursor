title: Neovim Unfocused Cursor
output: amaryaml::github
---

This plugin simply hides the cursor and cursor column when the window is not
focused.
This makes more sense than the default behaviour because you will not need to
move the cursor if you are not on the window, let alone see it.

# Installation

## Vim Plug

```vim
Plug "amarakon/nvim-lua-script"
```

## Neovim

```sh
`# user` git clone https://github.com/amarakon/nvim-sensible ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/default/start/nvim-sensible
```

# Setup

In order to use this plugin, you need to run the `setup` function.
If you are doing this in Vim Script instead of Lua, put `lua` in front of the
following code.

```lua
require("unfocused-cursor").setup()
```
